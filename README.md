### What is Daily UI?
Daily UI is a series of Design Challenges and sent out everyday.
<br>Daily UI Participants receive a new design task each day, and they are encouraged to create and share their designs based on the given prompt.
<br>Everyday I receive an email from Daily UI, with a Design Prompt/Challenge. I then use Canva, or any design tool of my choice, and I create a design of the prompt (e.g. a sign-up form, 404 page, and pricing section).

<strong>This is where I will be uploading my Daily UI completions everyday.<strong>
