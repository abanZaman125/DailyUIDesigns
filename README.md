<strong>What is Daily UI?</strong>
<br>
From the Daily UI website: "Daily UI is a series of Design Challenges and Surprise Rewards sent out everyday."
<br>Daily UI Participants receive a new design task each day, and they are encouraged to create and share their designs based on the given prompt.
<br>
This is where I will be uploading my Daily UI completions everyday.
